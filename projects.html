    <h1>Social buzz</h1>
    <p>
      I completed a minor project on data analytics, where I analyzed datasets
      provided for the SocialBuzz platform to identify the top 5 most popular
      content categories. In this project, each type of user reaction (like,
      love, laugh, etc.) was assigned a unique score based on its significance.
      Using the provided datasets, I analyzed user reactions to various posts,
      quantifying engagement by applying the reaction scores. The analysis
      helped me determine the top 5 content categories that received the highest
      overall engagement, offering valuable insights into user preferences and
      content effectiveness on the platform.
